# OverTheWire - Bandit CTF Challenges

## Introduction

OverTheWire’s **Bandit** is a beginner-level Capture The Flag (CTF) game designed to teach basic cybersecurity concepts like file permissions, user management, and shell exploitation. The challenges become progressively harder as you move up the levels.

This repository contains notes, solutions, and steps for solving each level of Bandit. I started this journey to improve my Linux command line skills and to get hands-on experience in cybersecurity.

## Folder Structure

The Bandit challenge is divided into levels. Each level contains a separate file where I'll document the challenge, steps to solve it, and the final solution. Here’s the breakdown:

- **level00.md**: Solution to Bandit Level 00
- **level01.md**: Solution to Bandit Level 01
- ...
- **level34.md**: Solution to Bandit Level 34

## Progress

- [Level 00](OverTheWire/Bandit/level00.md)
- [Level 01](OverTheWire/Bandit/level01.md)
- [Level 02](OverTheWire/Bandit/level02.md)
- [Level 03](OverTheWire/Bandit/level03.md)
- [Level 04](OverTheWire/Bandit/level04.md)
- ...

## Notes

The challenge uses a set of Linux commands and a few tools like `nc`, `cat`, `ssh`, and `find`. Every level teaches a new technique to solve the problem and gain access to the next level.
