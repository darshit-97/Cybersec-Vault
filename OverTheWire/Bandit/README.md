# OverTheWire - Bandit CTF Challenges

## üìö Introduction

OverTheWire‚Äôs **Bandit** is a **beginner-level** Capture The Flag (CTF) game designed to teach basic cybersecurity concepts like file permissions, user management, and shell exploitation. The challenges become progressively harder as you move up the levels.

This repository contains detailed notes, solutions, and steps for solving each level of **Bandit**. I started this journey to improve my **Linux command-line skills** and to get hands-on experience in **cybersecurity**.

## üóÇ Folder Structure

The Bandit challenge is divided into levels. Each level has a separate folder containing files for the **walkthrough**, **commands used**, and **explanations** of the solutions. Here‚Äôs the breakdown:

- **Level 0**
  - [README.md](Level0/README.md)

- **Level 1**
  - [walkthrough.md](level1/walkthrough.md)
  - [commands.md](level1/commands.md)
  - [explanation.md](level1/explanation.md)

- **Level 2**
  - [walkthrough.md](Level2/walkthrough.md)
  - [commands.md](Level2/commands.md)
  - [explanation.md](Level2/explanation.md)

- **...**
  - And so on...

## üí° Learning Method

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: The steps and solutions provided here are for **educational purposes** only. Please **understand the underlying concepts** rather than using them as shortcuts. The goal is to **build a strong foundation** in **Linux** and **cybersecurity practices**.

By documenting each level with **walkthroughs**, **commands used**, and **explanations**, I‚Äôm aiming to not only solve each level but also to understand **why** I‚Äôm using specific tools or techniques. This approach enhances learning and retention.

## üìù Additional Information

The **Bandit** challenge introduces key concepts that are fundamental for anyone in the field of **cybersecurity** or **ethical hacking**. Some of the key concepts covered are:

- **SSH Protocol**: Learn how to securely connect to remote machines.
- **Linux Commands**: Basic commands like `ls`, `cat`, `chmod`, `find`, etc.
- **File Permissions**: Learn how file permissions and access control work on Unix-based systems.
- **Text Processing Tools**: Using tools like `grep`, `awk`, and `sed` to manipulate text and files.
